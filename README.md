## Update #1 (Taken From My [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fn9jvr/update_1_generating_list_of_seeds_good_seed/))


### Intro
Hey everyone and welcome to my first update post for my "good-seed-generator".  In this update, I created a super simple program that generates a list of 100 seeds. 


### Research
The research for this project includes:
* A review for writing to files from Corey Schafer:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2ebFW8OYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2ebFW8OYM) 
* A post I made on the range of numbers for Minecraft seeds:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fn1xob/what\_is\_the\_range\_for\_minecraft\_seeds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fn1xob/what_is_the_range_for_minecraft_seeds/) 
* And, although I already had an environment that I liked, I decided to switch to Sublime for this project and used this video from Corey Schafer to set it up:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFciV6Ew5r4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFciV6Ew5r4) 


### Code
All of the code for this project can be found on this Github Page:  [https://github.com/CodeForeverAndEver/Good-Minecraft-Seed-Generator](https://github.com/CodeForeverAndEver/Good-Minecraft-Seed-Generator)  


### Coming Up Next
The next thing I am going to work on is (all automatically) putting the seeds into [Chunkbase Biome Finder](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/biome-finder) with Selenium, zooming out all the way to make sure the entire generated map is viewable, and then taking a screenshot with Selenium, and then cropping the image to just the map with Pillow. After that, I am going to work on creating an algorithm to check if the seed has all of the attributes that would define it as "good".


### Release Date Prediction
Currently, I think that the full thing will be released two weeks from now!
